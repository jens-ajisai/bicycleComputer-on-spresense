COMMENT: >>>
Initialization consists of the following parts.

- Initialize the hardware acceleration for rotation and format conversion.
- Initialize the lvgl library with one drawing buffer of height 30, the display driver, a display resolution of 240 x 240 and registration of the flush function.
- Initialize DMA for SPI transfer for faster refresh rates.
- Initialize and configure the ST7789 display. Set rotation to 180 degrees as the display is mounted upside down.
- Initialize all widgets which are

  - background colour
  - camera image
  - labels for

    - heart rate value
    - speed

  - debug labels for 

    - IP address
    - free SD card memory
    - GNSS coordinates
    - GNSS satellite count
    - shop name, distance and bearing
    - geofence id and transition

  - icons (images)

    - heart
    - battery
    - Bluetooth
    - GNSS
    - arrow for shop bearing
    - arrow for GNSS direction
    - ice cream
    - LTE
    - microphone
    - phone
    - rain and sun (weather)
    - battery icon with fill rectangle 

- Draw initialized widgets once
- Send a TFT_ON event to trigger switching on the backlight.

Depending on the compile flag use the font lv_font_notosans_j_16 or the lvgl default.
